# Secret_handshake_js

There are 2 types of people in the world: Those who understand binary, and those who don't. You and your fellow cohort of those in the “know”, decide to come up with a 
secret “handshake” using binary. 
1 = wink 
10 = double blink 
100 = close your eyes 
1000 = jump 
10000 = Reverse the order of the operations in the secret handshake 
                    ********Task********** 
Given a number, convert it to the appropriate sequence of events for a secret 
handshake. 
Example 
Given the input 3, the function would return the array ["wink", "double blink"] because 3 is 11 in binary. 
Given the input 19, the function would return the array ["double blink", "wink"] because 19 is 10011 in binary. Notice that the addition of 16 (10000 in binary) has 
caused the array to be reversed.
